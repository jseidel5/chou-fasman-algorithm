# Implementation of the Chou-Fasman algorithm  

This is my implementation of the Chou-Fasman method according to ([Chou and Fasman, 1974](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bi00699a002)).

The structure propensities were adopted from ([Sing et al., 2010](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fd8c/c95aec2d7af19ed28eea3688b3c231d0e745.pdf)) because the original paper 
only evaluated 19 proteins.
